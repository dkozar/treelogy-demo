## :zap: About Treelogy Demos

Treelogy is a simple versioning framework you might want to explore here:

https://github.com/dkozar/treelogy

* `Treelogy` is inspired by class inheritance in various programming languages
* Uses a version tree to keep track of changes
* Each version contains *atomic* parts called nodes
* The node can contain any type of data and could be overridden in child version
* Each node contains only *delta*, thus minimizing the memory footprint
